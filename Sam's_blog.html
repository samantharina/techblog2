<h2> "Humans Need Not Apply" </h2>
<h3> by Samantha </h3>


<img src="https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/robot.saladx392_0.jpg?sw=392">
<p> The Youtube clip "Humans Need not Apply" talks about the recent demand for robots, and how many jobs are starting to use robots to do tasks. The video explains that robots will soon take over mostly all of our job fields, as they already are, and put many people out of work. The video highlights many jobs that are already using robots (cars, pharmacists, artists) and how it's working smoothly. The video doesn't share any downsides to relying on robots for work, which might show bias on their part.  </p>
<p> I believe that although there are many tasks robots can be programmed to do, there are certain jobs that'll always require humans for. For example, entertainment. The entertainment industry relies on people who can sing, act, or use film equipment. Sure, robots can be promgrammed to take over this field, but since everyone has a certain taste and style they prefer, it would be difficult for robots to compete as well. </p>

	<h3> Good image </h3>
	<h4> Angel Ho </h4>
	<p> I love the image you picked for the blogpost because it really portrays how advanced technology has become. A robot is able to do labor that humans normally would do.</p>

<h2> "Blown to Bits" </h2>

<p> The first section I read was titled "Smile While We Snap". It explored photography. It focused on how photographers capture moments that are impactful and have the potential of going viral and catching the publics attention. </p>
<p> The second section I read was titled "Knowing Where You Are" and it described GPS systems. GPS in cars, phones, and other media, and how it "knows" how to track locations and give directions. </p>
<p> The final section was called "The Parking Garage Knows more Than You Think" and it summarized a story of a family who parked their car in a garage, and wasnt allowed to get it back once they were done because the garage had taken a photo of the license plate as it entered. </p>
<p> After reading excerpts from "Blown to Bits" I am fancinated to learn more about technology and realize the functions to things most of us take for granted. It's really cool, but also frightning how we're constantly surrounded by media and it has been the basis for most of our society.  </p>

	<h3> Good summaries </h3>
	<h4> Angel Ho </h4>
	<p> Each paragraph summed up the article you read in a efficient way. I also agree with your opinion on how frightening it is to be surrounded by media. </p>

<div class="comment">
	<h3> Wow </h3>
	<h4> Susie Warchol </h4>
	<p> I agree that it's frightening how much technology has improved. The story about the garage is really weird/scary if you had a very expensive car and couldn't get it back. </p>
